## Frontend-Development-Tasks

## Overview

This repository contains the completed tasks from my front-end development internship at CodeAlpha. The internship provided valuable hands-on experience in building modern web applications, enhancing my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and learning industry best practices for UI/UX, debugging, and optimization.
